# CarDealershipDatabase
My SQL project Workshop for car dealership database

This project is my SQL workshop for the car dealership database.  
I made one main SQL file that creates the database, the tables, and the sample data.

I also made 7 small SQL files for the required queries:
1. Get all dealerships
2. Get vehicles for one dealership
3. Find a car by VIN
4. Find the dealership that has a car (by VIN)
5. Find dealerships that have a certain car type
6. Get sales for a dealer in a date range
7. My own extra query (shows how many cars each dealership has)

I used MySQL Workbench to write and test everything.  
This project helped me understand how to create tables, add data, and write SQL queries.
